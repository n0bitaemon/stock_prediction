## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

The Stock Price Prediction project utilizes historical stock data to train machine learning models capable of predicting future stock prices. By leveraging this predictive power, investors can gain insights into potential price movements and make informed decisions regarding their investment strategies.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this project, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/n0bitaemon/stock_prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd stock-price-prediction`

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. **Data Collection**: We downloaded the historical stock dataset from a reliable source on Kaggle ([Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/r1shabhgupta/google-stock-price-daily-weekly-and-monthly-2023)) , and place it in the Dataset subfolder.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Open the code file corresponding to the desired algorithm in the `Models` folder.
   - Locate the section responsible for data preprocessing.
   - Implement the necessary data preprocessing steps, such as datatype convertion, feature selection, feature scaling and feature transformation, within the code file.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Open the code file corresponding to the desired algorithm in the `Models` folder.
   - Locate the section responsible for model training.
   - Implement the model training code using the preprocessed data.
   - Save the trained model in the `Models` subfolder.
   - Repeat these steps for each of the four models available in the `Models` folder.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Open the code file corresponding to the desired algorithm in the `Models` folder.
   - Locate the section responsible for model evaluation.
   - Implement the evaluation code using appropriate evaluation metrics.
   - Open the report file in the 'Report' subfolder to get comparative analysis of the results.

Remember to repeat the above steps for each algorithm or model within the `Models` folder to ensure complete preprocessing, training, and evaluation for all models.
